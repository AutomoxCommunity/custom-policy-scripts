# Automox Worklets

Native to the Automox platform is our worklet system. Our philosophy behind worklets is, "if you can script it, you can manage it." In this repository, you will find a wide variety of pre-packaged worklets that customers and Automox engineers and customers have created for you to use. Every worklet has an evaluation and remediation detail that can be customized.
