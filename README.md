# Automox Custom Policy Scripts

Native to the Automox platform is our Custom Policy Engine. Our philosophy behind custom policies is, "if you can script it, you can manage it." In this repository, you will find a wide variety of pre-packaged custom scripts that customers and Automox engineers have created for you to use. Every custom policy has an evaluation and remediation detail that can be customized.
